   Welcome to Virtual PC Simulator, Ver 0.16a.
   
   The VPCS can simulate up to 9 PCs. You can ping/traceroute them, or 
ping/traceroute the other hosts/routers from the VPCS when you study the Cisco 
routers in the dynamips. VPCS is not the traditional PC, it is just a program 
running on the Linux, Windows or OS X(need more testing), and only few network 
commands can be used in it. But VPCS can give you a big hand when you study 
the Cisco devices in the Dynamips. VPCS can replace the routers or VMware boxes
which are used as PCs in the dynamips network.

   Now, VPCS can be run in udp or ether mode. In the udp mode, VPCS sends or 
receives the packets via udp. In the ether mode, via /dev/tap, not support 
on the Windows.

   When VPCS started, it listens the ports from 20000 to 20008 and waits the 
dynamips to connect, and sends the packets to the ports from 30000 to 30008 which 
should be listened by the dynamips. 
   
   VPCS will look for the file named 'startup.vpc' in the current directory, and 
execute the commands in it if you are not set the startup file from the command 
line. All the commands in the startup file are the internal commands of the VPCS.
The line started with '#' or '!' will be discarded.

	vpcs [options]
           -u        udp mode, default
           -e        tap mode, using /dev/tapx
           -s port   local udp port, default from 20000
           -c port   remote udp port(dynamips udp ports), default from 30000
           -r file   run startup file

   NOTE: 
     To make compatible with the dynamips, VPCS does NOT use the cygwin1.dll 
   released by cygwin.com. These files conflicted. Please keep the latest 
   cygwin1.dll in your system.
